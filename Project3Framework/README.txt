Note: f implies the issue is fixed

Notes:
  - I added a ';' after <stmt> and <stmt_list>
  - for <param_list> I created a getter and setter to 
  set and return a boolean value. This boolean value will
  signal to us if the <param_list> being taken in is the first
  or one of many. This is relevant because it tells us whether
  or not we need to print a comma that precedes the parameter.


Problems:
f - indent of the 'return __RetVal' is still off 
f - after statement outputs an object there's a space then ';'
       example: Object("a") ; outputs instead of Object("a");
