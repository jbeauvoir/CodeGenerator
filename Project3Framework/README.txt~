Note: f implies the issue is fixed


Jacques BEGIN

Notes:
  - I added a ';' after <stmt> and <stmt_list>
  
  - for <param_list> I created a getter and setter to 
  set and return a boolean value. This boolean value will
  signal to us if the <param_list> being taken in is the first
  or one of many. This is relevant because it tells us whether
  or not we need to print a comma that precedes the parameter.
  
  - careful using the "genString" variable in WriteCode, it may have something
  stored in it you don't want to use.
  
  - With regards to the previous bullet, only use genString when 
  you store a lexeme ( ex: genString = lex->GetLexeme() ). For other
  strings just put the string in as a WriteCode paramater



Problems:
f - indent of the 'return __RetVal' is still off 
f - after statement outputs an object there's a space then ';'
       example: Object("a") ; outputs instead of Object("a");
  - Skipped production rule 20 -> not sure if anything needs to 
    be done inside of it
